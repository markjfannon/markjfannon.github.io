    DomBot is a Discord bot made in JS, modelled off Dominic Howard of the band "Muse". <br>
    He was made for a Muse fan server, with several features to fit it's, uh, <i>strange</i>nature.
    Several features include responses tagging other bots, some of which may not be present on your own server.<br>

    The main feauture is random face emoji responses to messages that begin with "DomBot" that are not commands.

    His command prefix is "DomBot", and has a "help" command to list his commands and how to use them.

    Add DomBot to your server <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=746305721523634236&permissions=379968&scope=bot">here</a>!
