    <p>DomBot is a Discord bot made in JS, modelled off Dominic Howard of the band "Muse". </p><br>
 
    <p>He was made for a Muse fan server, with several features to fit it's, uh, <i>strange</i> nature.</p><br>

    <p>Several features include responses tagging other bots, some of which may not be present on your own server.</p><br>

    <p>The main feauture is random face emoji responses to messages that begin with "DomBot" that are not commands.</p><br>

    <p>His command prefix is "DomBot", and has a "help" command to list his commands and how to use them.</p><br>

    <p>Add DomBot to your server <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=746305721523634236&permissions=379968&scope=bot">here</a>!</p>
