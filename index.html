<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Hi! I'm Mark and I'm a Year 13 student. I've made this website so I can have everything I've made and done (there's not much!) in one place! 
As you can also probably tell, I'm dreadful at web design and this might provide me an excuse to be a bit better at it :)

I have a strong interest in Cyber Security, especially in OSINT and pentesting. This is a field I wish to go into in later life.
Aside from CS, I also enjoy learning new musical instruments and playing with others (guitar, bass, piano/keyboards) as well as acting!</p>
